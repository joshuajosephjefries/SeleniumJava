1. TESTNG
I have used a custom listener that opens the extent report in chrome browser once the execution is completed.
Features of the Custom Listener:
   Used extent reports for reporting with ExtentSparkReporter
   Reporting shows START, PASS, FAIL, & SKIPPED
   Report opens in the browser upon reaching the end of execution
   Screenshots are saved in /screenshots/ folder
   Better Naming for Screenshot Files, that includes date and time
   Detailed Step Execution in Console Output
   Includes Step Logs in the Report
