## TESTNG
I have used a custom listener that opens the extent report in Chrome browser once the execution is completed.

[!NOTE] Features of the Custom Listener

   <li> Used extent reports for reporting with ExtentSparkReporter </li>
   <li> Reporting shows START, PASS, FAIL, & SKIPPED </li>
   <li> Report opens in the browser upon reaching the end of execution </li>
   <li> Screenshots are saved in /screenshots/ folder </li>
   <li> Better Naming for Screenshot Files, that includes date and time </li>
   <li> Detailed Step Execution in Console Output </li>
   <li> Includes Step Logs in the Report </li>
